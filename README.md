Kelsey Blackman: Project 2A and 2B

I plan on creating a website using Webstorm. This website's topic will be ideas for librarians to use to market/reach teen patrons. I am in the Masters in Library and Information Science, and I think creating a website that embodies the library side and the technology side is a good option for this assignment.
